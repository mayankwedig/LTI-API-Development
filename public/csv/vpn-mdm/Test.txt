If you won\'t even give me an indication of what\'s causing the error it is very difficult to resolve it at the client end. I cannot believe that it is just an IP change which causes it so there must be errors still showing after the IP is unblocked.

The client wan\'t pay the additional huge cost of moving the mail to VPS, mainly caused by the backup requirement, for just 1 of the many email accounts on the domain.
